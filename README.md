# get_shitty_python
VSCode extension that makes Python objectively shittier. 

NEVER USE IN PRODUCTION.

DO NOT USE THIS EXTENSION.

THIS IS A JOKE EXTENSION.

The extension will add useless comments, unsightly whitespace, end statements with semi-colons, and add parentheses where they are not needed.
